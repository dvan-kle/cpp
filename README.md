# C++ Modules

## Introduction

Welcome to the **C++ Modules**! This project is part of the 42 and CODAM curriculum, designed to provide students with a deep understanding of the C++ programming language. Each module covers specific aspects of C++ and is aimed at gradually increasing your proficiency in object-oriented programming, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Modules Overview

The C++ Modules are divided into several projects. Below is an overview:

1. **Module 00 - Introduction to C++**
   - Learning the basics of C++ syntax
   - Understanding the standard input/output
   - Working with the basic data types and operators

2. **Module 01 - Memory Allocation and References**
   - Dynamic memory allocation
   - Working with pointers and references
   - Understanding constructors and destructors

3. **Module 02 - Ad-Hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overloading**
   - Operator overloading
   - Understanding ad-hoc polymorphism
   - Working with namespaces

4. **Module 03 - Inheritance**
   - Understanding inheritance and derived classes
   - Working with base classes and access specifiers
   - Virtual functions and polymorphism

5. **Module 04 - Abstract Classes and Interfaces**
   - Abstract base classes
   - Pure virtual functions
   - Implementing interfaces

6. **Module 05 - Repetition and Exceptions**
   - Handling exceptions in C++
   - Understanding the try-catch mechanism
   - Custom exception classes

7. **Module 06 - C++ Casts**
   - Static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts
   - Working with different cast types

8. **Module 07 - STL Containers**
   - Introduction to the Standard Template Library (STL)
   - Working with vectors, stacks, queues, and maps
   - Iterators and algorithms

9. **Module 08 - Templated Programming**
   - Understanding templates and their usage
   - Function templates and class templates
   - Specialization of templates

10. **Module 09 - Smart Pointers**
    - Introduction to smart pointers
    - Working with `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`
    - Managing memory using smart pointers
